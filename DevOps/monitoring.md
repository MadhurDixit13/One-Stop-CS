# Monitoring

Monitoring is the continuous collection, analysis, and visualization of system metrics, logs, and traces to ensure application health, performance, and reliability.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Monitoring helps teams:
- **Detect Issues Early**: Identify problems before users are affected
- **Understand System Behavior**: Gain visibility into application performance and resource usage
- **Enable Data-Driven Decisions**: Use metrics to optimize and scale systems
- **Support Incident Response**: Quickly diagnose and resolve production issues
- **Track SLAs/SLOs**: Ensure service level objectives are met

## Core Concepts

### Observability Pillars
- **Metrics**: Numerical time-series data (CPU, memory, request rate, latency)
- **Logs**: Textual event records for debugging and auditing
- **Traces**: End-to-end request flows through distributed systems

### Key Metrics (Golden Signals)
- **Latency**: Request/response time
- **Traffic**: Request volume
- **Errors**: Failure rate
- **Saturation**: Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)

### Monitoring Types
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Server health, resource usage, network performance
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Code-level traces, transaction monitoring
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Proactive health checks and uptime monitoring
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Client-side performance tracking
- **Log Monitoring**: Centralized log aggregation and analysis

## Popular Tools & Platforms

### Open Source
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Log aggregation and search
- **Jaeger / Zipkin**: Distributed tracing
- **Nagios / Zabbix**: Infrastructure monitoring

### Commercial/SaaS
- **Datadog**: Full-stack observability platform
- **New Relic**: APM and infrastructure monitoring
- **Splunk**: Log analytics and SIEM
- **Dynatrace**: AI-powered observability
- **AWS CloudWatch**: AWS-native monitoring
- **Google Cloud Monitoring**: GCP-native monitoring
- **Azure Monitor**: Azure-native monitoring

## Best Practices

- **Define Clear SLOs/SLAs**: Set measurable service objectives
- **Use the Four Golden Signals**: Focus on latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- **Avoid Alert Fatigue**: Configure meaningful thresholds; reduce noise
- **Implement Distributed Tracing**: Essential for microservices and cloud-native apps
- **Centralize Logs**: Aggregate logs for easier debugging and correlation
- **Monitor the Monitoring**: Ensure monitoring systems are reliable and performant
- **Automate Alerting**: Integrate with incident management tools (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- **Build Dashboards for Different Audiences**: Ops dashboards vs. executive summaries
- **Tag and Label Everything**: Enable filtering and aggregation by service, environment, team
