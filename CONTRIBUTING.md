    Args:
        arr: Sorted list of integers
        target: Value to search for
        
    Returns:
        Index of target if found, -1 otherwise
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```

#### Java
```java

 * Performs binary search on a sorted array.
 * 
 * @param arr Sorted array of integers
 * @param target Value to search for
 * @return Index of target if found, -1 otherwise
 */

    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {

    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
