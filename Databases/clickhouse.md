# ClickHouse

ClickHouse is an open-source, column-oriented database management system optimized for real-time analytical queries (OLAP) on massive datasets.

---

## What Problem Does It Solve?

ClickHouse addresses:
- **Slow Analytical Queries**: Orders of magnitude faster than traditional row-based databases for analytics
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Sub-second query performance on billions of rows
- **Data Volume Challenges**: Efficiently stores and queries petabytes of data with high compression
- **Complex Aggregations**: Handles complex analytical workloads (GROUP BY, JOIN, window functions)
- **High Ingestion Rate**: Supports millions of rows inserted per second

---

## Core Concepts

### Column-Oriented Storage
- Data stored by columns, not rows
- **Advantages**: Read only needed columns, better compression, CPU cache efficiency
- **Use Case**: Analytics queries that scan large datasets but access few columns

### Key Features
- **Blazing Fast**: 100-1000x faster than traditional SQL databases for analytics
- **SQL Support**: Standard SQL with extensions (arrays, tuples, nested structures)
- **Data Compression**: 10-100x compression ratio (LZ4, ZSTD, Gorilla)
- **Distributed Architecture**: Sharding and replication for horizontal scaling
- **Vectorized Execution**: SIMD instructions for parallel query processing
- **Multiple Table Engines**: MergeTree (default), ReplicatedMergeTree, Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL

### Table Engines (MergeTree Family)
- **MergeTree**: Default engine for analytics, supports primary keys, partitioning, TTL
- **ReplicatedMergeTree**: Automatic replication across nodes
- **SummingMergeTree**: Pre-aggregates numeric columns
- **AggregatingMergeTree**: Stores intermediate aggregation states
- **CollapsingMergeTree**: Handles mutable data via row versioning

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Web & App Analytics**: User behavior tracking, event analytics (alternative to Google Analytics)
- **Log Analytics**: Application logs, security logs, access logs
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Business intelligence, operational metrics
- **Time-Series Data**: IoT sensor data, monitoring metrics, financial market data
- **Data Warehousing**: OLAP workloads, reporting, ad-hoc analysis
- **Observability**: Metrics, traces, logs (alternative to Elasticsearch)

## Example Schema & Queries

### Create Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_date Date,
    event_time DateTime,
    user_id UInt64,
    event_name String,
    country String,
    revenue Float64
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(event_date)
ORDER BY (event_date, user_id);
```

### Insert Data
```sql
INSERT INTO events VALUES
    ('2024-01-15', '2024-01-15 10:30:00', 1001, 'page_view', 'US', 0),
    ('2024-01-15', '2024-01-15 11:00:00', 1002, 'purchase', 'UK', 99.99);
```

### Query Examples
```sql
-- Aggregation query
SELECT
    country,
    COUNT(*) AS events,
    SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM events
WHERE event_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Time-series query with window functions
SELECT
    toStartOfHour(event_time) AS hour,
    event_name,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    AVG(revenue) AS avg_revenue
FROM events
WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
GROUP BY hour, event_name
ORDER BY hour, count DESC;
```

## Architecture & Deployment

### Deployment Options
- **Single Node**: Development, small datasets
- **Cluster**: Sharding and replication for production
- **ClickHouse Cloud**: Managed service by ClickHouse Inc.
- **Docker**: Quick setup for testing

### Distributed Query Execution
- **Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning across nodes
- **Replication**: Data redundancy for fault tolerance
- **Distributed Table**: Virtual table that queries shards transparently

```sql
-- Create distributed table
CREATE TABLE events_distributed AS events
ENGINE = Distributed(cluster_name, database_name, events, rand());
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- **Choose Right Primary Key**: Most frequently filtered columns (low cardinality first)
- **Use Partitioning**: By date for time-series data (faster TTL, easier data management)
- **Enable Compression**: ZSTD for storage, LZ4 for CPU balance
- **Avoid High-Cardinality Primary Keys**: Increases index size and memory usage
- **Use Materialized Views**: Pre-aggregate common queries

### Data Ingestion
- **Batch Inserts**: Insert in batches (1000-100K rows) for better performance
- **Async Inserts**: Use async_insert for high-throughput scenarios
- **Use ClickHouse Kafka Engine**: Stream from Kafka directly
- **Avoid Frequent Small Inserts**: Causes merge overhead

### Monitoring & Operations
- **Monitor Merges**: Background merges consolidate data parts
- **Track Query Performance**: Use `system.query_log` table
- **Set TTL**: Automatically delete old data
- **Replication Lag**: Monitor `system.replicas` for replication health
